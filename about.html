                <p>
                    I was peeking through the curtain, looking out the window. I can only decscribe what I saw
                    as beauty. It's raining the streets are empty, change is approaching. TIK, TIK , TIK as the
                    clock on the wall remind me that time is running out. As I write, the world is facing a threat,
                    people are in fear. Freedom has been taken away. People have lost jobs, businesses are down and
                    we're
                    under home arrest. living in times like this sure feels terrible, but not for everyone.

                <span class="heading">Tip of my fingers:</span>
                <p> This
                    lockdown doesn't feel like much to me. All I need is not in malls or gatherings but right at the
                    tip of
                    my fingers, the computer. If you start messing around with various softwares, you switch your
                    computer
                    from being just a storage box to a toolbox. Once you identify useful computer tools
                    and learn to manipulate them, you finally understand why such a machine have such value and
                    reputation. A Computer is powerful but the manipulator is the one who controls the powers. The
                    powers
                    that these
                    home arrest cannot take away. If anything, the lockdown just gives you peace. Peace to build this
                    template
                    and
                    host it online.

                <span class="heading">Dopamine:</span>
                <p>
                    It could've been a scripted animation but I hate that for several reasons:
                    <blockquote>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You take alot of time desgning and drawing before animating.</li>
                            <li> You need to do voice overs and that sucks, I don't have the voice.</li>
                            <li>You need to write a story. This one also sucks because you don't just write any
                                story but
                                a story
                                suitable for 2d animation and storyboarding.</li>
                        </ul>

                <p>
                    None other than Mphielo and Quinton (My Niggas) know I used to spend several hours,
                    for animation I never publish or let alone complete. I seem to be jumping from one project to
                    another
                    searching for dopamine. A ton of the work i never got to cloud is fried along with my computer
                    hard
                    drive. As noted on the home page, i'm just filling the empty spaces. I don't know if i'll ever
                    have
                    time to update this template as am looking completetly to other directions.
