                <div class="info">

                <p> <span class="C">Choose</span> your path, no one's gonna choose for you. The reality is that life
                    doesn't
                    come with a manual, though we're all familiar with historic scripts that claim to
                    be 'the manual' and I'm not in anyway trying to dismiss them. This text is not about
                    that. There is a saying: <span>
                        <blockquote>"Extraodinary claims require extraodinary proof."</blockquote>
                    </span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    We live in the world of documented ethics and morals. Such a world is judicial.
                    The thing is, others see in you what the mirror cannot reflect. The reason why
                    a psychiatrist cannot treat himself. This blindness to self makes us judgemental. We're one
                    and the same, we're like the swarm of ants operating together for the same purpose.
                    One cannot be without the other. We feel disconected and different from one another but
                    that's just an <span class="gib">illusion</span>.</p>


                <p>We're a social species. On a fundamental level we're all walking the same path.
                    Destined for the same purpose. We construct our future
                    based on the images of those who sarround us. We have people which whom we look up to, people
                    who have achieved what we want to achieve and it is those individuals who give us hope.
                    We listen to they're tails of how
                    they got to the top. They're our <span class="inf">influence</span>. We follow try and follow
                    they're path.</p>

                <p>Pressure of peers, ethics and morals are also parts of what drives us. More often we choose to do
                    what is
                    expected of us not wanting to fail those who look up to us. This is peharps why:
                    <blockquote> History repeat itself. </blockquote>To have a different path, one have to make
                    sacrifices. Secrifices that few to none have endure. Sometimes it's not worth it.</p>

                    This is just a mind of my own playing random notes of the song
                    of life. I could never have written this if it wasn't for the that fact that a
                    website need context.I'm just filling out empty spaces. [see about]</p>
